 * Topic: Polimorphism (Many Forms)- Same object act in different ways 
 * - Two Types 
 *  1. Method Overloading (Compile Time) - Same method and different parameters/types 
 *      E.g.  register(c1,c2);  register(c1,c2,c3);
 *  2. Method Overriding (RunTime) - Same method and parameters/types
 *     - Used in Inheritance - Parant and Child Classes
 *      E.g.  getCredits();  getCredits();
