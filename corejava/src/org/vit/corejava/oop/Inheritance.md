# Java OOP: Inheritance
## Inheritance 
- Getting Property from Parent
`Parent -> Parent Class / Base Class / Super Class`
`Children -> Child Class  / Derived Class / Sub Class`
- Types
-- Single Inheritance (A->B)
-- Multilevel Inheritance (A->B->C)
-- Hierarchical Inheritance (A->B,A->C, A->D) 
- Keyword Used in Java: `extends`
- When to use: If the objects are coming under `is-a` relationship
```java
class A {}
class B extends A {}
```
